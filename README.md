1. Project Title

Hospitality Revenue & Performance Analytics Dashboard – Multi-City Hotel Chain (2022)

2. Description

This Hospitality Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive, end-to-end analysis of hotel performance across multiple cities and properties.
The dashboard focuses on revenue, occupancy, pricing efficiency, room utilization, cancellations, and customer ratings, enabling hotel management to monitor operational health, identify underperforming properties, and optimize pricing and inventory strategies.
The project simulates a real-world hospitality analytics use case where business decisions are driven through data cleaning, modeling, KPI design, and interactive visual storytelling.

3. Tech Stack

Power BI – Interactive dashboards & data visualization
Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation & modeling
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – KPIs, calculated measures & time intelligence
Microsoft Excel / CSV – Raw data handling
Synthetic Hospitality Dataset – Property-level hotel performance data

4. Data Source
Custom Synthetic Hospitality Dataset (2025) containing:
Property-level hotel data
City and room category details (Business / Luxury)
Revenue & pricing metrics
Occupancy and utilization metrics
Booking and cancellation indicators
Customer rating information
This dataset was designed to closely resemble real hotel management system (HMS) data.

5. Features / Highlights
🔹 Business Problem
Hospitality businesses face multiple operational challenges, including:
Fluctuating occupancy across cities and seasons
Inefficient pricing strategies impacting RevPAR and ADR
High cancellation rates reducing realized revenue
Difficulty comparing performance across multiple properties
Lack of a centralized performance monitoring system
Without a consolidated analytics dashboard, hotel decisions remain reactive instead of data-driven, leading to revenue leakage and poor resource utilization.
🔹 Goal of the Dashboard
Analyze overall revenue performance across cities and properties
Track RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %, and Realisation %
Identify top-performing and underperforming hotels
Understand Business vs Luxury category contribution
Monitor booking cancellations and customer ratings
Enable data-driven pricing, inventory, and operational decisions

High cancellation rates directly impact revenue realization
Some properties show strong occupancy but weak pricing efficiency
Customer ratings correlate with better realization and lower cancellations
